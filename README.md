My-Emacs-config
===============

Playing a bit with Gnus and Emacs ;-)

Coming from Sublime Text as my main desktop editor, the goal of this configuration is to achieve *the perfect* Usenet environment as well as a nice-to-use programming and random notes editor which tries to work as comfortably as possible.

I guess we'll never be nearly there.
