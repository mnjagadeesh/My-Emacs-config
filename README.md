My-Emacs-config
===============

Playing a bit with Gnus and Emacs ;-)

The goal of this configuration is - for now - to build *the perfect* Usenet reading environment. There are no text editor optimizations (yet) as I am still using [Vim](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder/My-Vim-configuration) and Sublime Text as my preferred text editors. Sorry, Emacs fans.

On the other hand, this enables me to optimize my configuration for this one usage. Let's see how far I get. Improvements, anyone?
