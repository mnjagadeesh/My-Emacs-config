My-Emacs-config
===============

Playing a bit with Gnus and Emacs ;-)

Don't get me wrong here, I am still using [Vim](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder/My-Vim-configuration) and Sublime Text as my preferred text editors, so Emacs (Gnus) is only used as my daily NNTP client. Sorry, Emacs fans.

On the other hand, this enables me to optimize my configuration for this one usage. Let's see how far I get. Improvements, anyone?
